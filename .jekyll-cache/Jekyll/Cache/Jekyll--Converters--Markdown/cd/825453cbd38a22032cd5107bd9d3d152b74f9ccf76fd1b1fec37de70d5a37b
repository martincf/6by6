I"Å<p>There are people who love Elvis.
It‚Äôs not a figure of speech.
It‚Äôs a real, honest to goodness, all out love.
They buy his records, watch his movies, his concerts, his every move. People ink his face on their arms.
They sing to his records, sing in the car, alone.
People sing at karaoke, they buy a wig, rings, belts, a suit.
They are In Love.
They pay Tribute to the King.</p>

I"7<p><em>There are people who love Elvis.</em></p>

<p><em>It’s not a figure of speech.</em></p>

<p><em>It’s a real, honest to goodness, all out love.</em></p>

<p><em>They buy his records, watch his movies, his concerts, his every move. People ink his face on their arms.</em></p>

<p><em>They sing to his records, sing in the car, alone.</em></p>

<p><em>People sing at karaoke, they buy a wig, rings, belts, a suit.</em></p>

<p><em>They are In Love.</em></p>

<p><em>They pay Tribute to the King.</em></p>

<p><strong>These words are from Graeme Oxby’s photobook <em>The Kings of England</em>, a collection of portraits and reportage featuring Elvis impersonators taken from all over the UK over a period of five years.</strong></p>

<p>The project started as an exploration of the iconography of popular culture and of Presley himself, arguably the most photographed man on the planet. But it developed into a more personal study of the hundreds of Presley devotees Oxby met.</p>

<p>Coming mainly from working class backgrounds, the Elvis impersonators shared their own stories of personal tragedy and vulnerability. In taking on the personae of Elvis they wanted to perpetuate the memory of the King, but also a way of life that has been diminished following the closure of coal mines, steel foundries and manufacturing centres across the UK.</p>

<p>The result is a series of intimate personal portraits showing the drama, colour and spectacle of these Kings of England.</p>

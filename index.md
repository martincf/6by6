**Six By Six will launch September 2019. Exhibitions will be held every six weeks including talks and occasional exhibition-specific workshops. **

The first event will be Thursday 19th September; an evening of photographic conversations and debate.  

Six By Six's mission is to start conversations, spark debate and grow a network of people interested in photography. Our home is a venue that is not a traditional gallery; it's a place where we ill stimulate informal discussions and display work. Lightbox Gallery at Ropes & Twines has a history of supporting photography. Is relaxed atmosphere will provide the ideal space to debate notions of contemporary photography. 

Six By Six is a group of established documentary photographers: [Craig Easton](https://www.craigeaston.com), [Colin McPherson](http://www.colinmcpherson.com), [Stephen McCoy](http://mccoywynne.co.uk), [Stephanie Wynne](http://mccoywynne.co.uk), [Tadhg Devlin](https://www.tadhgdevlin.com), and [Adam Lee](http://www.adamleephotography.com/Home.html).

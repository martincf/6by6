**Six By Six launched in September 2019. Exhibitions are held every six  weeks, including talks and occasional exhibition-specific workshops. **

Six By Six's mission is to start conversations, spark debate and grow a network of people interested in photography. Our home is a venue that is not a traditional gallery; it's a place where we ill stimulate informal discussions and display work. Lightbox Gallery at Ropes & Twines has a history of supporting photography. Is relaxed atmosphere will provide the ideal space to debate notions of contemporary photography. 

Six By Six is a group of established documentary photographers: [Tadhg Devlin](https://www.tadhgdevlin.com), [Craig Easton](https://www.craigeaston.com), [Adam Lee](http://www.adamleephotography.com/Home.html), [Stephen McCoy](http://mccoywynne.co.uk), [Colin McPherson](http://www.colinmcpherson.com), and  [Stephanie Wynne](http://mccoywynne.co.uk).
